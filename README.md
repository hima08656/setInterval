# Loading Screen Simulation with setInterval

This project demonstrates how to simulate a loading screen using JavaScript's `setInterval` and `setTimeout`.

## Behavior:
- Logs `"Loading..."` every second.
- After 5 seconds, stops the interval and logs `"Loaded successfully!"`.

## Files:
- `Krishna.js`: Contains the logic.
- `Krishna.html`: Loads the script in a browser.
